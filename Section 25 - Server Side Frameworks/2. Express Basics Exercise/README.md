# Express Routing Assignment

1. Create a brand new Express app from scratch.
2. Create a `package.json` using `npm init` and add express as a dependency.
3. In your main app.js file, add 3 different routes:

| Route             | Expected Output                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`               | "Hi there, welcome to my assignment!"                       |
| `/speak/pig`      | "The pig says 'oink'!"                                      |
| `/speak/cow`      | "The cow says 'moo'!"                                       |
| `/speak/dog`      | "The dog says 'woof woof'!"                                 |
| `/repeat/hello/3` | "hello hello hello"                                         |
| `/repeat/hello/5` | "hello hello hello hello hello"                             |
| `/repeat/blah/2`  | "blah blah"                                                 |
| Any other route   | "Sorry, page not found. What are you doing with your life?" |

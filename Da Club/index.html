    <p>
      Hello, and welcome to Da Club. Before we can let you in to enjoy these
      good times, we have to have our bouncer, Gregory, ask you for your age:
    </p>
    <br />
    <input required type="text" id="age" />
    <input type="submit" onclick="checkName();" /> <br />
    <p>
      We don't like to broadcast who is allowed in and who is not - check the
      browser console.
    </p>
